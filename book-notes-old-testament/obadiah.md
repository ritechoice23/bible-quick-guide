### About the Author

Obadiah's ministry was directed toward the nation of Edom, which descended from Esau, the twin brother of Jacob. The book of Obadiah denounces Edom's pride, violence, and mistreatment of their brother nation, Israel. Obadiah's message exposes the consequences of their actions and declares God's judgment upon Edom. Despite their present triumph, Obadiah assures Israel of their restoration and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.

### Historical Context

The historical context of Obadiah revolves around the relationship between Edom and Israel. Edom, as a neighboring nation, demonstrated hostility and animosity towards Israel throughout their history. During the Babylonian invasion and destruction of Jerusalem, the Edomites rejoiced over Israel's downfall, exacerbating their judgment. Obadiah's prophecy addresses this historical context, proclaiming God's judgment against Edom for their mistreatment of Israel.

In the cultural context of Obadiah, Edom represents the epitome of pride and violence. They took advantage of their geographical position and engaged in raids, looting, and oppression. Edom's actions reflected a deep-seated hatred and rivalry towards Israel, rooted in their ancestral conflict between Esau and Jacob. Obadiah's prophecy challenges this cultural mindset, revealing God's judgment against Edom and His faithfulness to His chosen people.

### The Event that Inspires the Writing of the Book
