### About the Author

Jonah was the son of Amittai from the town of Gath Hepher in the region of Zebulun. He was a prophet from the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Jeroboam II. He is also mentioned in 2 Kings 14:25, where he prophesied the restoration of Israel's borders. He was chosen by God to deliver a message of warning and repentance to the city of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. However, Jonah initially resisted God's command and tried to flee by boarding a ship. Through a series of events, including being swallowed by a great fish, Jonah learned the importance of obedience and the extent of God's mercy.

### Historical Context

The historical context of Jonah is set during the reign of King Jeroboam II of Israel, around the 8th century BC. The Assyrian Empire was a dominant power in the region, known for its cruelty and military might. Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, was a wicked city that represented the epitome of sin and idolatry. God called Jonah to prophesy against Nineveh and warn them of impending judgment.

### Cultural Context

In the cultural context of Jonah, the relationship between the Israelites and the Assyrians was marked by animosity and conflict. Assyria was viewed as a ruthless and oppressive empire, while Israel often struggled with idolatry and disobedience to God. The book of Jonah challenges these cultural biases by showcasing God's desire for all people, including the Assyrians, to repent and receive His mercy.

### The Event that Inspires the Writing of the Book

The event that inspires the writing of the book of Jonah is Jonah's reluctant obedience and the subsequent repentance of the city of Nineveh. Despite Jonah's initial resistance, God used him as a vessel to deliver a message of warning and hope to Nineveh. The unexpected response of the Ninevites, who repented and turned to God, showcases the extent of His mercy and forgiveness.
