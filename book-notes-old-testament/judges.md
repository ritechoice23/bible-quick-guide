### About the Author

The Book of Judges does not explicitly mention its author. However, traditionally, the authorship has been attributed to the prophet Samuel, who played a significant role in the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel. Samuel's parents were Elkanah and Hannah. He was born in Ramathaim Zophim and became a judge, prophet, and anointer of kings. Samuel's sons, Joel and Abijah, did not walk in his way. (1 Samuel 1-25)

### Historical Context

The book is set during the time after Joshua's leadership when the Israelites settled in the Promised Land. It covers a period of about 350 years, characterized by tribal conflicts and cycles of apostasy. The book of Judges bridges the gap between the conquest of Canaan and the establishment of the monarchy under Saul.

### Cultural Context

The cultural context of the book reflects a decentralized society governed by tribal leaders known as judges. The Israelites were surrounded by pagan nations and often fell into idolatry, leading to God's discipline through foreign oppression. The book portrays the challenges of maintaining faithfulness to God in the midst of a culture that tempted them to worship false gods.
