### Author

The apostle Paul, a former persecutor of Christians, became a fervent follower of Jesus Christ after a dramatic encounter on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-19). Paul, also known as Saul, was born in Tarsus and was a highly educated Pharisee. He dedicated his life to spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, writing numerous epistles, including the Book of Romans.

### About the Author

Paul, originally named Saul, was born in Tarsus, a city in modern-day Turkey. He was a Pharisee and a zealous persecutor of Christians until his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. After his conversion, Paul became one of the most influential figures in early Christianity. He embarked on missionary journeys, established churches, and wrote several letters to instruct and encourage believers. Paul's teachings and writings profoundly shaped Christian theology. He ultimately died as a martyr for his faith.

### Historical Context

The Book of Romans was written during Paul's third missionary journey, likely from the city of Corinth. At the time, the Roman Empire was a dominant force, and Rome served as its capital. The early Christian community in Rome comprised both Jewish and Gentile believers, leading to potential tensions and questions regarding the relationship between the Old and New Covenants. Paul's letter to the Romans addresses these issues and provides a comprehensive theological framework for understanding God's plan of salvation.

### Cultural Context

Rome was a diverse and cosmopolitan city, with people from various cultures and backgrounds. The Roman Empire encompassed different regions and religions, including the worship of numerous gods and goddesses. In this context, Christianity emerged as a distinct and growing movement. Paul's letter to the Romans was written to believers navigating this cultural milieu, emphasizing the need for unity, faith, and righteous living in the midst of societal pressures.

### The Event that Inspires the Writing of the Book

The primary event that inspired the writing of the Book of Romans was Paul's desire to visit the believers in Rome and support their faith. However, because he had not yet been able to visit them, he decided to write a comprehensive letter addressing

important theological and practical matters. Paul wanted to lay a solid foundation of faith and ensure that the believers in Rome understood the essential doctrines of Christianity, especially regarding salvation, grace, and righteousness.
