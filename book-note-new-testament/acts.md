### Author

The Book of Acts is attributed to Luke, the same author of the Gospel of Luke. Luke was a physician and a close companion of the apostle Paul (Colossians 4:14, Philemon 1:24). He diligently researched and recorded the accounts of Jesus' life and ministry in his Gospel, and in Acts, he continues the narrative by chronicling the early years of the Christian church and Paul's missionary journeys.

### About the Author

Luke, the author of Acts, was a Gentile convert to Christianity. He was a beloved companion of the apostle Paul, accompanying him on various missionary journeys. Luke's meticulous attention to detail and his desire to provide an accurate and orderly account of the events of Jesus' life and the early church make his writings invaluable. Tradition suggests that Luke was a skilled physician, and his Gospel and Acts reflect his careful and methodical approach to recording historical events. He remained faithful to his calling as a disciple of Christ and is believed to have died as a martyr for his faith.

### Historical Context

Acts takes place immediately following the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ. It provides a historical account of the early Christian church and its rapid expansion. The book covers a period of approximately 30 years, from the ascension of Jesus to the apostle Paul's imprisonment in Rome. During this time, the Roman Empire exerted significant influence over the Mediterranean region, providing a diverse cultural backdrop for the spread of the gospel.

### Cultural Context

The cultural context of Acts is marked by the presence of various religious, philosophical, and socio-cultural beliefs prevalent in the Roman Empire. Judaism played a significant role, as the early Christian movement emerged within the Jewish community and faced both acceptance and opposition from Jewish religious leaders. The Roman Empire's dominance and the widespread Greek influence also shaped the cultural environment in which the apostles and early believers carried out their ministry.

### The Event that Inspires the Writing of the Book

The primary event that inspired the writing of the Book of Acts was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. This event marked the beginning of the fulfillment of

Jesus' promise to send the Holy Spirit as a comforter and empower the disciples to be His witnesses (Acts 1:8). The remarkable manifestations of the Spirit's power, including speaking in tongues and bold preaching, stirred the curiosity of the people and led to the conversion of thousands.
