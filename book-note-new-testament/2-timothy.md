Paul, formerly known as Saul, was a Pharisee who persecuted Christians until his encounter with Jesus Christ (Acts 9:1-19). After his conversion, Paul became a fervent preacher of the gospel, planting churches and mentoring young leaders like Timothy. He endured numerous hardships and imprisonments for the sake of Christ. In 2 Timothy, Paul writes from prison, facing imminent martyrdom. His words reflect his deep faith, unwavering commitment to the gospel, and his desire to pass on the torch of ministry to the next generation.

### Historical Context

In this context, Paul's teachings in 2 Timothy encouraged believers to remain faithful to Christ despite the challenges and temptations they faced.
