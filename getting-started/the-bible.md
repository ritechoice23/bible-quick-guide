The Bible is comprised of **66 books in total**. Sectioned into two, the Old and New Testament.

The Old Testament contains **39 books**, while the New Testament consists of **27 books**. These books encompass a wide range of themes, including creation, history, wisdom, prophecy, and the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The Bible contains approximately **31,102 verses**, which serve as a rich source of guidance and spiritual insight.

The Bible contains historical narratives, poetry, prophetic writings, letters, and other genres. It is not a mere human invention or a book of mythology. Rather, it is the divinely inspired revelation of God's truth and His relationship with humanity.
